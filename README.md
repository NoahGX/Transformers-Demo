# Transformers-Demo

## Overview
In this Jupyter notebook, we demonstrate two key concepts related to Transformer and Transformer-Based models:  
  - A step-by-step implementation of the **multi-head attention** mechanism in a Transformer encoder, focusing on the basic computation of Q, K, V, attention scores, and weighted outputs.
  - An exploration of various **transformer-based NLP models** from the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library for multiple natural language processing tasks.  

## Features
  - Clear Python code illustrating how to calculate the **Query (Q)**, **Key (K)**, and **Value (V)** matrices.
  - Demonstration of attention score computation and softmax normalization.
  - Examples using **Hugging Face Transformers** for various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, etc.  

## Usage 
  1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
  2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
  3. Run the cells in order to see the step-by-step implementation and outputs.  

## Prerequisites
  - **Python 3.7+**
  - **NumPy**
  - **SciPy**
  - **Jupyter Notebook vs JupyterLab**
  - [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org/) (version compatible with your CUDA setup if using GPUs)
  - [**Hugging Face Transformers**](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) (for additional transformer-based NLP tasks)
  - Install required packages via pip:
      ```bash
        pip install torch numpy scipy transformers
      ```

## Input
  - The notebook uses randomly generated data (`x`) to demonstrate multi-head attention calculations.
  - For exploring **transformers** library tasks, you can provide your own texts or datasets for inference.  

## Output
  - Intermediate print statements show the shape and sample contents of Q, K, V matrices, attention scores, and weighted outputs.
  - Log outputs from Hugging Face Transformers (if you run additional cells focusing on NLP tasks).

## Notes
  - The random seeds are set for reproducibility.
  - This notebook focuses on a conceptual understanding of multi-head attention in Transformers.
  - In practice, you would replicate the attention mechanism across multiple heads, then concatenate or project the combined output.
  - For large-scale tasks, consider using GPU-accelerated hardware to speed up computations.
