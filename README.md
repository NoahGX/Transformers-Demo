# Transformers-Demo

## Overview
In this Jupyter notebook, we demonstrate two key concepts related to Transformer and Transformer-Based models:  
  - A step-by-step implementation of the **multi-head attention** mechanism in a Transformer encoder, focusing on the basic computation of Q, K, V, attention scores, and weighted outputs.
  - An exploration of various **transformer-based NLP models** from the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library for multiple natural language processing tasks.  

## Features
  - Clear Python code illustrating how to calculate the **Query (Q)**, **Key (K)**, and **Value (V)** matrices.
  - Demonstration of attention score computation and softmax normalization.
  - Examples using **Hugging Face Transformers** for various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, etc.  

## Usage 
  1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
  2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
  3. Run the cells in order to see the step-by-step implementation and outputs.
